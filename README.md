project should:

    take in an age (years) and convert to seconds
        (ideally, take in an exact date. perhaps even time of day, if known)

    given two dates, determine the difference in seconds between them

    given an age, return age in Mercury years (0.24 Earth years)

    given an age, return age in Venus years (0.62 Earth years)

    given an age, return age in Mars years (1.88 Earth years)

    given an age, return age in Jupiter years (11.86 Earth years)

    given an age and planet, return time left to live (life expectancy minus current age on that planet)
        (if user has already surpassed life expectancy, return a different output)



room for expansion:

    given an age, return age in Saturn years (29.48 Earth years)

    given an age, return age in Uranus years (84.07 Earth years)

    given an age, return age in Neptune years (164.90 Earth years)

    UI w/ solar theme styling

    given an age and planet, return user's next birthday on that planet
